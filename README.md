# minesweeper
Minesweeper clone. Demo is available here https://gorankami.github.io/minesweeper/

## Instructions
First, install modules with `npm install`. 

Build the app with `npm start`. That will create `build/index.html` that you can launch in any browser 
(like `firefox ./build/index.html`).

Run tests with `npm test`, but note that tests are there only to demonstrate test example (it's incomplete). 
Navigation was very helpful though.

##Technical info
For modularity, this app uses webpack and mocha testing tool. Unly JS lib used is jQuery 3.x
